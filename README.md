# Othello_Python
## Created by Daniel Burns
## Rewritten in Python3
**Origin/Rules**:

Othello is a board game where 2 players face against eachother. The game is played on a 8x8 uncheckered board. Each player will take a turn placing his/her colored disk (X's and O's in this digital version of the game) onto the board. If any disks become bounded on sides by disks of the opposite color, then the color swithces to the disks they are bounded by.

When it is your turn, you **must** place a disk adjacent to another disk on the board (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The object of the game is to have the most disks of your color on the board when no more moves are available.

**Inspiration**:

Othello was one of my first "bigger" programs I wrote for a course assignment while at the University of Notre Dame. This program was initially written by me in C++. Hackers in the Bazaar, of my last courses at the University of Notre Dame,gave me the opportunity to experience first-hand the creation of an open source project for other people to contribute to. I chose Othello as my open source project because I wanted to (1) see how much cleaner I could make the program when writing it in Python and (2) was excited to learn if I could implement a "game" as a Python package.

**End Goal**:

My end goal for this project is for other contributors to design a computer for the user to play against, rather than requiring another human player. It will be interesting to observe how the computer gets smarter as more people contribute to it.
