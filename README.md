## A game of Othello written in Python
**Origin/Rules**:
Othello is a board game where 2 players face against eachother. The game is played on a 8x8 uncheckered board. Each player will take a turn placing his/her colored disk (X's and O's in this digital version of the game) onto the board. If any disks become bounded on sides by disks of the opposite color, then the color swithces to the disks they are bounded by.
When it is your turn, you **must** place a disk adjacent to another disk on the board (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The object of the game is to have the most disks of your color on the board when no more moves are available.
**To install:** `pip install Othello_Python`
